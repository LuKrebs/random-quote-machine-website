<p>This is a Random Quote Machine that was build with HTML,CSS, Bootstrap and also JavaScript/Jquery. The main purpose of this project is to work with the core concepts of all that touch the Front-end world. I strongly believe in learn by doing.</p>

<p>It's also a <a href="http://freecodecamp.com">Front-end challenge on FreeCodeCamp</a>. If you want to see it online, you can find it in my <a href="http://codepen.io/LuKrebs/full/PpZjBB/">CodePen profile</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to use this tamplate in your own projects or to message me if you want some aditional information.</p>

<p>The image below show us a quick preview of what this front-end pen looks like: </p>
